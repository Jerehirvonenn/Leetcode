/*
 * Leetcode 1094 - Car Pooling (Medium)
 *
 * Problem:
 * You are given an integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where
 * trips[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates a trip from `fromi`
 * to `toi` carrying `numPassengersi` passengers.
 *
 * The car drives only east (i.e., increasing distance), and must never
 * exceed its seating `capacity` at any moment.
 *
 * Return true if all trips can be completed without exceeding capacity.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Use a difference array (`in_out`) to mark passenger change at each point.
 * - At `from`, increment passengers; at `to`, decrement.
 * - Then perform a prefix sum to simulate passenger count as the car moves.
 * - If at any point the number of passengers exceeds capacity, return false.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N + D), where N = number of trips, D â‰¤ 1000 (max distance)
 * Space Complexity: O(D) for tracking passenger deltas at each location
