/*
 * Leetcode 1710 - Maximum Units on a Truck (Easy)
 *
 * Problem:
 * You are given a 2D vector `boxTypes`, where each element is [numberOfBoxes, unitsPerBox].
 * You're also given an integer `truckSize` which is the max number of boxes the truck can carry.
 * 
 * Goal:
 * - Load the truck with boxes to maximize the total number of units.
 * - You can select any type of box and as many as you like,
 *   as long as the total number of boxes â‰¤ truckSize.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Sort box types in descending order based on units per box.
 * - Greedily take as many as possible from the most valuable (unit-wise) box types.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) extra (in-place sorting).
