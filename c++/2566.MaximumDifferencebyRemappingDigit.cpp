/*
 * Leetcode 2566 - Maximum Difference by Remapping a Digit (Easy)
 *
 * Problem:
 * You are given an integer num. You know that Bob will sneakily remap one digit (0â€“9) to another digit.
 * He does this separately for maximizing and minimizing the number.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - When remapping digit d1 to d2, all occurrences of d1 are replaced with d2.
 * - Bob can remap a digit to itself (no change).
 * - Leading zeroes are allowed after remapping.
 * 
 * Task:
 * Return the maximum difference possible between a "maximized" and a "minimized" version of num.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Convert the number to a string.
 * - For max:
 *     - Replace the first non-9 digit with '9' in all its occurrences.
 * - For min:
 *     - Replace all occurrences of the first digit with '0'.
 * - Convert both back to int and return the difference.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of digits in num
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for the string copies
